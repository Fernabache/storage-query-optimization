# Storage & Query Optimization

A Python-based system that implements intelligent query analysis and ML-based storage tiering to optimize database performance and storage costs.

## Features

### Query Analysis & Optimization
- Analyzes SQL query structure and complexity
- Generates execution plans and performance metrics
- Provides optimization recommendations
- Tracks execution time and query patterns

### Storage Optimization
- Classifies data into hot, warm, and cold tiers based on access patterns
- Automates storage tiering decisions using configurable rules
- Calculates potential storage cost savings
- Generates optimization reports and recommendations

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/storage-query-optimization.git
cd storage-query-optimization
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Query Optimization
```python
from query_optimizer.analyzer import QueryAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = QueryAnalyzer(connection_string="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db")

# Analyze a query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;"
results = analyzer.optimize_query(query)
print(results['recommendations'])
```

### Storage Tiering
```python
from storage_manager.classifier import StorageTierManager

# Initialize storage manager
manager = StorageTierManager()

# Classify data
data = pd.read_csv("data/sample_data.csv")
classified_data = manager.classify_data(data)

# Generate report
report = manager.generate_optimization_report(classified_data)
print(report['recommendations'])
```

## Required Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- sqlalchemy
- psycopg2-binary
- sqlparse
